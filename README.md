PrepForSubmission
=================

A script I wrote to copy a Visual Studio solution directory, and delete unneeded files in preparation for submission on Blackboard. 

*DISCLAIMER: This batch file is provided AS-IS, it's your responsibility to have backups, and to double-check before submission!*

## How to use

1: Drop the .bat file in the solution folder, alongside the *.sln file.

2: Run the batch file, and choose a folder name.

3: Your new folder is created, and unneeded files removed.
